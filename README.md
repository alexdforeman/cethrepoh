cethrepoh
=========

Please use the ruby branch this will be master when I bother to swap them.  Having said that Java version is working perfectly as well.  Just a recommendation to use the ruby branch.

A generic spellchecker for production applications and websites.  Or any sources that you desire.


========

Once complete cethrepoh (pronounced SEE THREE PEE OH) is generic spell checker which via three simple interfaces provides a way of supplying sources that you want to check for spelling mistakes and create Dictionarys of known correct words however you like and will spell check them for you.

Currently this is early stages but I hope to improve this over the next few months when I get time to include the ability to scan websites / Android applications / iOS / BB10 etc or in fact anything that can be parsed and turned into the list of strings that a user will be reading.

The next stage after that is a generic output in XML with some XSLT to generate human readable reports.

Please enjoy and let me know if I can help you by improving it in anyway.
